# Augmented-reality-OpenCV

Augmented reality has started becoming mainstream in a number of applications.  
In this assignment, you will build an augmented reality application with your own webcam.
  1.  Calculate the camera calibration matrix for your webcam using multiple views of a chessboardpattern.
  2.  Create three visual markers which are easy to detect.
  3.  For a single visual marker, take a video input from the webcam.  Estimate and explicitly printout the pose of the camera 
  (R,t) for every frame.  Render a 3D model (.obj file) on top of thevisual marker as if the model is lying vertically on the 
  marker.
  4.  In  this  part,  there  are  two  visual  markers.   The  first  visual  marker  lies  on  a  flat  surface.The second 
  marker is in a plane roughly perpendicular to the plane of the first marker.  The augmented  object  starts  moving  from  
  the first  marker  and  stops  when  it  hits  the  second marker.
